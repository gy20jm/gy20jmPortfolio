Contents:
README.md- contains an outline of the software and what it is meant to achieve when run, as well as a list of files within the repository.
LICENCE.md- a licence stating permissions for the software.
in.txt- the csv file containing the data relevant to the creation of the environment.
model.py- the python file containing the main code for the software. This includes; the import for all required modules, the variables to be used, the empty lists, the code pertaining to
the importing of the environment csv file (in.txt), as well as the code to plot and animate the agents.
agentframework.py- a separate python file containing the code for the creation of the Agent class and the move, eat, share and distance_between functions.

What the software is expected to do when run:
The software within this repository creates a number of agents and an environment for them to exist in. These agents are then moved and given instructions to eat the environment. This
process is animated and the new eaten environment is shown in a pop-up window. The separate blocks of code (each relating to a different process within the software) are separated and
commented on to provide context. Some of these processes have been tested using the print function which checks to see if these are working correctly.
